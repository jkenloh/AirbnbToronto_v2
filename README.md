# [Airbnb Toronto Listings Project](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ken.loh/viz/Airbnbv2_17094345780450/Dashboard)

**This data analysis project analyzes the number of Airbnb listings in Toronto, Ontario.**

This project involves:

1) Using **Python** for data cleaning and preparation:
   * Individual CSV files for each month were downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com/toronto/.
   * The CSV files were cleaned and combined into one CSV to prepare the data for Tableau.

Python Code: [view code on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/jkenloh/AirbnbToronto_v2/blob/main/Airbnb%20Project%20v2%20-%20Python%20Code.ipynb)
  
2) Using **Tableau** for data visualization and analysis:
   * A GeoJSON file, also downloaded from the same data source, was joined with my prepared data table directly within Tableau. This was done to obtain geographic data related to the neighborhoods for mapping in the visualization.
